 Mar 7th 2019 	 The London Stock Exchange is thriving despite Brexit 	['WHEN LSE Group, the parent company of the London Stock Exchange, Europe’s largest, released its 2018 annual results on March 1st, there was an elephant on the trading floor.

Britain may be in political turmoil and banks may be shifting jobs and assets out of London, but Brexit is doing little to perturb LSE. Last year the group’s revenue grew by 8% and its operating profit by 15%. Its share price is up by 22% since December. LSE did announce 250 job cuts, 5% of its staff, but after 27 acquisitions and investments in the past decade, it has some tidying to do. It retains five different offices in New York, for example.']

The new 50-storey tower contains 274 luxury flats that range in value from a merely expensive £1m ($1.3m) to an eye-watering £15m. Thanks to its distinctive midriff the building has been nicknamed “The Tummy” by Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel economics prize for his work on spotting asset bubbles. The name might also apply to London’s bloated housing market. Prices have nearly doubled since 2009.', 'It is not only in London that property values bulged in the decade after a housing bust that nearly took down the world’s financial system: prices are near new highs in many places, according to The Economist’s latest roundup of global housing markets (see chart).

The old City of public-school amateurism, late starts, early finishes and long, boozy lunches disappeared. In its place, a new City emerged under the sway of American investment banks. The morning meeting started two hours earlier. Lunch was a sandwich at your desk. And instead of port and cigars, try mineral water.', 'It was time to sober up, too, because America’s influence on the London market went well beyond the acquisition by its banks of a few old-school stockbrokers. America was home to much of the world’s capital. As more buying and selling of assets took place across borders and time zones, the New York trading day set the tone for markets everywhere else. A City broker had to be at his desk, and with his wits about him, when the New York market opened just after lunchtime in London.']

The Danish lender’s Estonian branch is suspected of handling up to $230bn of iffy funds from former Soviet states. Aftershocks are rumbling under other European banks. Shares in Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International tumbled by more than 12% on March 5th after a complaint was filed accusing it (and, to a lesser extent, other Austrian banks) of “gross negligence or acquiescence” in connection with suspicious flows from Danske. Raiffeisen says it is investigating.', 'Raiffeisen is just the latest bank to be suspected of channelling dirty money from Europe’s eastern fringes. Helsinki-based Nordea and Sweden’s Swedbank are among those embroiled in the Danske affair. Swedbank’s share price has shed 18% since it was linked to Danske last month (see chart). Some banks have been stained by a separate scheme, the “Troika Laundromat”.

He says profits are important and dismisses handouts to small businesses as “government largesse”. Yet appearances can deceive. “I’m an economist by training, and a commercial banker by profession,” he says. “Now I’m a development banker.”', 'Mr Okpanachi is the boss of Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), a wholesale lender to small firms that started operating in 2017.

Poor countries account for over three-quarters of the tally, but NDBs are also popular in the rich world. France and Canada have recently opened three between them. Myanmar and Ghana are rolling out new ones. Britain unusually, has no NDB—but some politicians want one.']
 Mar 7th 2019 	 Spooked by slowdown, the ECB rolls out stimulus 	['THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK is usually a predictable beast, shy of springing monetary-policy surprises. Take, for instance, its move to halt new asset purchases last year: it had been telegraphed for so long that traders could have got away with sleeping through it.\xa0', 'But anyone dozing on a trading floor on March 7th would have been in trouble. The ECB announced two measures to counter a slowing of the euro zone’s economy. The bank pledged to keep interest rates on hold for longer—“at least through the end of 2019”—having previously said it would keep rates at rock-bottom until the summer. And it announced a third round of “targeted longer-term refinancing operations” (TLTRO-III), which will make cheap loans to banks. The euro fell by 0.6% against the dollar, to its lowest level against the greenback since mid-November.']

When a wave of Japanese imports arrived in America in the 1980s, their city was one of the places most vulnerable to the new competition. In 1974, 4,500 of them worked at making farm machinery and equipment. As many again made tyres and inner tubes. By 1990 only a little over half of those jobs were left. Yet in the intervening 16 years thousands of new jobs had sprouted, in life insurance, building materials and the restaurant trade. In 1990 Des Moines’ unemployment rate was below 4%, less than the national average of 5.6%.', 'Not everyone fared as well. Mary Kate Batistich and Timothy Bond, of Purdue University, have recently estimated that the “Japan shock” explains about one-fifth of the fall in African-Americans’ labour-force participation between 1970 and 1990. But Des Moines’ experience was typical. Kerwin Kofi Charles, Erik Hurst and Mariel Schwartz, of the University of Chicago, found that local declines in manufacturing employment in the 1980s were not associated with increases in local unemployment rates.']

Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, which became the biggest parliamentary party at last year’s general election, hailed the launch of his signature policy as a “revolution”. But critics say the scheme is unaffordable and could blunt the incentive to work.', 'Despite its name, the citizens’ income is aimed at the poorest Italians—more than 5m live in poverty, or 8.4% of the population, up from 3.9% a decade ago. Eligible applicants must earn less than €6,000 ($6,780) a year, have less than €6,000 in the bank, and cannot own a car that is less than six months old.

The government has dispatched two million boffins to visit companies, stores and even street stalls in the first few months of this year, as part of a new national economic census.

In a flashy promotional video on its website, the national statistics bureau warns that any fabrication of data is against the law.', 'But these laudable efforts do not appear to be solving the basic problems with Chinese statistics. A new paper, by Chang-Tai Hsieh of the University of Chicago and three co-authors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, finds that industrial output and investment have been consistently embellished. As a result, they argue that China overstated real GDP growth by two percentage points on average every year from 2008 to 2016 (see chart). Over time that adds up: official figures for 2016 would have exaggerated the size of the economy by 16%, or more than $1.5trn.']

It suggests that equity investors can best glean insight into a firm by quizzing its chief executive. But bosses are not always reliable narrators. Their position encourages them to be overly optimistic about their company’s outlook. Sometimes they are clueless. And occasionally they are careless about what they tweet.', 'On February 25th the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), America’s financial-market regulator, asked a federal judge to hold Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, a carmaker, in contempt. Mr Musk’s troubles with the SEC began in August when his tweet claiming that he had secured funding to take Tesla private caused the firm’s share price to soar. When the claim proved false, the SEC sued him for securities fraud. They settled in October, when Mr Musk stood down as Tesla’s chairman (he remains chief executive), paid a $20m fine and agreed to have his tweets approved by Tesla’s lawyers. He violated that last condition on February 20th by tweeting that Tesla would produce 500,000 vehicles this year—a claim he later had to clarify—without consulting the firm.']

Bankers grumble about subterranean official interest rates—they must pay the European Central Bank 0.4% a year to deposit cash—that show no sign of rising. Those compound an old problem: Germany’s extraordinarily crowded banking market. The country has 1,580 banks, grouped in three “pillars”: private, public and co-operative. Although the grand total is shrinking by 40-60 a year, the public pillar still contains 385 Sparkassen—savings banks, mainly municipally owned—and half a dozen Landesbanken—regional lenders, such as Helaba, that also act as clearers for Sparkassen. There are 875 local co-ops. Their clearer and corporate lender, DZ Bank, is Germany’s second-biggest bank by assets.']

The past decade has seen a flurry of such schemes: China, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia all now have them. Latvia will launch one later this year.', 'The aim is to make it harder for retail businesses to evade taxes. Worldwide, 20-35% of government revenue comes from value-added taxes (VAT) or similar levies on consumption. But as much as a third of what should be collected is thought to be forfeited because businesses under-report revenues. The problem is not business-to-business transactions; firms can usually reclaim any VAT they pay if they keep proper records. But when selling direct to consumers, it is tempting to accept cash without recording the sale. A tax-dodging retailer can undercut law-abiding rivals or pocket a higher margin.']

What economic policies might it have pursued in a third term? This is not an entirely idle question. Any assessment of Mr Modi’s economic record in his first stint as prime minister requires a counterfactual scenario against which to measure it. A third UPA government is one such baseline.', 'A Congress-led government would no doubt have built on some of its existing pet initiatives, such as a job guarantee, providing employment on public works to rural households, and an identification scheme, giving every Indian a unique identity number based on a fingerprint or an iris scan.

Gossip is prized but in short supply. Much of it is concerns John Quinn, a womaniser who has buried two wives and is looking for a third. His quest takes him to Knock, a shrine to the Virgin Mary, which has become a place to find a partner. Like many pilgrims, John Quinn is outwardly pious. But his mind is fixed on earthly matters.', 'The masking of intent may also be true of visitors to the temple of private equity. On the surface, investors in such funds might hope to harvest a reward—an “illiquidity premium”—for locking up their money for five to ten years.

But seven months later, and with large loans to repay, he sold up. “We decided we’d better take what we have,” he says.', 'The cause of the crash was a 25% tariff on American soyabeans imposed by China, the world’s biggest importer, as one shot in the trade war between the two countries. Yet peace is supposedly in the offing. The two countries are locked in negotiations over a deal, ahead of a deadline of March 1st that has been imposed by America (though on February 19th President Donald Trump declared the timing to be flexible). That Mr Bardole cut his losses despite those talks is not that surprising. Even if the tariff is lifted—which is far from certain—the past year’s disruption will probably leave a permanent scar.']

Two years later she doubled the contributions, working several part-time jobs, after her aunt told her that her father had been in an accident and needed money for medical bills. But another call from her aunt last winter, claiming that her father was asking for yet more money, made her suspicious. “He wasn’t the kind of man to ask his daughter for money,” she says.

Economists’ reluctance is understandable: efforts to help struggling communities might well deter people from moving when they would otherwise have relocated to more promising places. But it is also short-sighted, argues Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago and the former head of India’s central bank. In a compelling new book, “The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind”, he argues that communities are not so much a source of friction inhibiting the smooth operation of the global economy, as an indispensable part of a healthy society.']

Credit-default swaps (CDSs) are insurance-like derivatives designed to compensate lenders when a company goes bust. A simple enough aim, you might think, but there are plenty of devilish details. A company can go bust in many ways: it can close and have its assets sold off, or restructure its debt and keep operating.

An estimate by Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University put the country’s inflation rate last year at 100,000%, with prices doubling roughly once a month. The IMF reckons that in 2019 it may reach 10,000,000%.', 'Hyperinflations are not an exclusively modern problem. Rome suffered one under the emperor Diocletian. But the spread of fiat currencies, backed by the credibility of a government rather than a physical commodity such as gold, has made them more common. They came in devastating bursts over the past century: in the aftermath of the first and second world wars, during the post-Soviet transition from communism to capitalism, and more recently in misgoverned poor countries, mostly in Africa and Latin America. They are not cases of garden-variety inflation run amok. Rather, they demonstrate a catastrophic breakdown in a state’s capacity to govern. In a narrow sense, they are a monetary phenomenon, with printing presses running nonstop. Yet the important question for economists, and for those trying to end them, is why the presses ran out of control in the first place.']

But far from increasing general satisfaction, this plan is controversial.', 'At first glance, it is hard to see why. On January 25th representatives of 76 WTO members gathered at the annual shindig in Davos announced plans to negotiate new rules covering “trade-related aspects of electronic commerce”. Compared with the trade talks between America and China that restarted this week in Washington, this venture seems positively collegial. It makes sense: trade rules were written when cloud computing was the stuff of science fiction.

Like much of the world’s media, Donald Trump tweeted this week that China’s growth in 2018 was its slowest in nearly three decades. This, he said, ought to compel it to make a “Real Deal” on trade with America. China’s growth of 6.6% last year was indeed the weakest since 1990, and the country does want to end the trade war. But a closer look at the data shows why its leaders are less panicked than Mr Trump might think.', 'First, the sheer size of its economy means that China’s growth last year generated a record amount of new production. Nominal\xa0GDP\xa0increased by 8trn yuan ($1.2trn), well above the 5.1trn yuan added in 2007, when it notched up 14.2%, its fastest growth in recent decades.

To underline his argument, Mr Volcker made a bold claim. The most useful financial innovation—indeed the only beneficial one—of recent decades, he said, had been the ATM.', 'Mr Volcker is right about many things, but wrong about this one. The prize must go to the index fund, pioneered in the mid-1970s by John Bogle, who died last week aged 89. The idea behind it was simple: a mutual fund that mimicked the S&P 500 index of leading American stocks. An index fund holds stocks in exact proportion to their importance (measured by their market capitalisation) to the overall stockmarket. Because such a fund owns all the stocks in the index, it is diversified: it is not overly exposed to the risk that a single firm, or group of firms, would fail. Above all, an index fund is cheap to run. It has no need to employ expensive stockpickers. Turnover costs are trivial. You only buy a stock when it joins the index, and sell it when it leaves. Otherwise you just hold the index.']

In the last four months of last year some lenders’ stocks dropped by 20%-plus, far more than the S&P 500’s 13.6%.

The earnings of workers without a college education have scarcely risen in 50 years, after adjusting for inflation; for men they have fallen. This stagnation coincided with tectonic changes in American employment. The share of jobs that require either a lot of training, or very little, has grown since 1970. Much of the production and office work that requires moderate training, which once employed vast numbers of workers without college degrees, has disappeared, either shipped abroad or offloaded on robots and computers. The resulting hardship has been implicated in a rise in mortality in parts of America and the turn toward angry nationalism that helped put Donald Trump in the White House.']

After markets closed in America, Apple warned that a sharp slowdown in China’s economy, and weak sales in other emerging markets, meant revenues in the fourth quarter would undershoot expectations by up to 10%. Coming a day after news that China’s manufacturing sector contracted in December, that spooked investors globally. S&P 500 futures dipped before Wall Street re-opened on January 3rd.']
 Jan 3rd 2019 	 A profit warning from Apple jolts markets 	['INVESTORS WERE skittish as 2018 drew to a close, fretting about global economic prospects. Fears about a slowdown in China have swirled in recent weeks: the pace of GDP growth fell over the course of 2018, as did retail and vehicle sales. The purchasing managers’ index survey, released on January 2nd, suggested that manufacturing activity in China had contracted in December.', 'Later that day Apple said it was revising down its earnings expectations in the fourth quarter of 2018, largely because of lower sales and signs of economic weakness in China. The news rapidly infected financial markets. Apple’s share price fell by around 7% in after-hours trading and the decline was extended to more than 10% when the market opened. The dollar fell by 3.7% against the yen in a matter of minutes after the announcement, before rapidly recovering some ground. Asian stockmarkets closed down on January 3rd and European ones opened lower. Yields on government bonds fell as investors fled to the traditional haven in a market storm.']

One is the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which came into effect on December 30th. Negotiated as the\xa0TPP\xa0between 12 countries and agreed between 11, after President Donald Trump pulled America out, the deal will phase out tariffs on frozen potato chips and mashed potato, benefiting Lamb Weston’s Canadian rivals.

 Dec 18th 2018 	 Transparency threatens Isle of Man insurers’ business model 	['', 'THE SEASIDE promenade in Douglas, on the Isle of Man, a self-governing British Crown dependency, boasts grand Victorian buildings and a horse-drawn tram. Once they helped it to compete with the likes of Llandudno and Blackpool for the tourist masses of England’s north-west. When cheap air travel meant these holiday towns were abandoned, most fell into disrepair. But Douglas reinvented itself as an offshore financial centre. Today finance provides over a third of the island’s GDP, of which around half is from insurance. Now new transparency rules put that at risk.']
 Dec 22nd 2018 	 Why Americans and Britons work such long hours 	['THE YEAR ahead will, like every year, consist of just under 8,800 hours. Most people will spend about a third of that time sleeping, and another third or so arguing on social media. Much of the remainder will be spent at work. There is increased interest in corners of the political world in trying to reduce the amount of time people must spend on the job. The Labour Party in Britain has said it will consider introducing a four-day work week when it is next in power. Figures on the American left are similarly intrigued by the idea. To assess whether such moves to reduce working time have any merit first requires an understanding of why hours in those countries have not fallen more already.', 'Declines in hours worked per person are among the least-sung benefits of economic development. In the late 19th century workers in industrialised economies knew labour and little else. In 1870 full-time work generally meant between 60 and 70 hours of labour per week, or more than 3,000 hours per year. Over the century that followed rising incomes were accompanied by a steady drop in weekly hours, which had fallen to about 40, on average, by 1970. Though less conspicuous a boon than larger pay packets or higher living standards, the drop was a gift to working people of a thousand or so precious hours of free time each year.']
 Dec 18th 2018 	 Why foreign investors are losing interest in India 	['', 'IT WOULD BE wrong to say that the only people who attended English county cricket in the 1980s were scoreboard enthusiasts, old men with flasks of cold tea and red-faced types there for the all-day bar. A few oddballs went to watch the cricket. A big draw was Graeme Hick, a Zimbabwe-born batsman and a relentless runmaker for Worcestershire. He eventually qualified to play for England in 1991. In front of bigger crowds and faster bowling, he could not reproduce his blistering county form.']
 Dec 18th 2018 	 China scrambles to sustain its trade truce with America 	['', 'THEIR WORDS were guarded, their tone sober. At a Politburo meeting to discuss economic plans for 2019, China’s top leaders agreed that they should be ready for problems and must, above all, maintain domestic stability. It was a striking contrast with the same meeting a year earlier. Then the Politburo oozed confidence, concluding that China was the world’s economic engine, with a new level of power.']

 Dec 15th 2018 	 Mauricio Macri hopes for a recovery in time for the next presidential election 	['', 'ARGENTINA IS FAMED as much for its financial crashes as for its juicy steaks and nifty footballers. But even compared with its usual performance, 2018 was a particularly miserable year for the economy. The worst drought in 50 years wrecked the corn and soyabean harvests, knocking 2% off GDP. The peso lost half its value against the dollar, pushing inflation to 46%. That tipped the country into its second recession in three years and led to a crisis that forced it to seek one of the largest credit lines in the IMF’s history. The approval rating of Mauricio Macri, the president, is at an all-time low. But as the year ends, there are reasons to hope that 2019 will be better.']

Since 2012 Mr Lewangu, who keeps goats and cattle, has bought insurance designed by the International Livestock Research Institute, based in Nairobi. The satellite monitors vegetation; when it is unusually scarce, he gets a payout. He can then buy food for his animals or pay a rancher for access to grazing land, without which his cows would die.']
 Dec 13th 2018 	 Urjit Patel, the head of the Reserve Bank of India, resigns 	['', 'LAST MONTH Viral Acharya, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), suggested in a speech that the Indian government was risking “economic fire” by meddling with the bank. If he was right, on December 10th the last chance of dousing the flames may have been missed. Urjit Patel, the RBI’s governor, abruptly resigned, citing “personal reasons”.

 Dec 14th 2018 	 Seeking lessons from China’s long economic boom 	['THAT CHINA has had decades of stellar growth is beyond doubt. More controversial is what can be learned from it. Does China prove that the basic tenets of developmental economics are right? Or does it argue for an overhaul? These questions brought together an august group of Chinese and foreign economists on December 9th in Beijing. They debated a new report that distils China’s experience into a handful of lessons which, the authors argue, belong in textbooks. But judging from the reaction, publishers will not be rushing to pulp current editions just yet.', 'The exercise, held at Tsinghua University, was a reflection on the start four decades ago of China’s “reform and opening” period, the rebirth of the economy following Mao’s disastrous rule. The anniversary is intensely political. Yet it is also a good moment to ask how China has done so well. Forty years ago, it had a 2% share of global GDP in terms of purchasing-power parity; now it has more than 18%.']

Despite cost-cutting and divestments, Bunge’s share price is 28% below its February peak, even after a 3% jump when the reshuffle became public.

Calm was restored.', 'It could not last. On December 10th, Urjit Patel, the bank’s governor, announced his resignation, citing “personal reasons”. This time few expected it, though with the bank’s next board meeting on December 14th, it should perhaps have been predictable. In recent months, RBI board meetings—which used to pass almost unnoticed—have become day-long battles. Board members friendly to the central government, in particular Swaminathan Gurumurthy, a firebrand Hindu nationalist journalist appointed in August, have used their roles to argue for changes to RBI policy. Mr Patel fought back. In late October, the argument spilled into the open as Viral Acharya, one of the RBI’s deputy governors, gave a speech denouncing interference with central bank independence.']

China will increase its purchase of American farm produce, energy and some industrial goods. In exchange America will delay an escalation in tariffs, from 10% to 25% on $200bn of goods planned for January 1st. That is on hold until March 1st at the earliest.

 Nov 29th 2018 	 Paul Volcker’s memoir invites a rethink of the fight against inflation 	['', 'PAUL VOLCKER’S legend is almost as grand and imposing as his physical personage, all six feet and seven inches of it. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter chose him to run the Federal Reserve and tackle America’s high inflation. Mr Volcker acted with grim determination, tightening monetary policy even as the economy sank into deep recession and beleaguered Americans pleaded for relief. Eventually he not only routed inflation, but also won a hard-earned credibility for the Fed that would help successors keep inflation stable. Mr Volcker himself recounts the story in a new memoir, “Keeping At It”, which calls on central banks to resist the siren song of loose money. But the book also invites readers to reconsider his legacy, and to ask whether central bankers have drawn the right lessons from the legend of Chairman Volcker.']
